## rux-SublimeText

Syntax highlighting for [rux](https://github.com/camertron/rux) files.

## Installation

For the moment, rux-SublimeText isn't published to package control. You'll need to install it manually for now.

1. Choose **Sublime Text** -> **Preferences** -> **Browse Packages** (sorry, not sure what the equivalent is on Windows). This should open a Finder window showing a list of all your installed packages.
1. Clone this repository into your Packages directory.

Here's a handy one-liner assuming you've got Sublime Text 3:

```bash
git clone \
  https://github.com/camertron/rux-SublimeText.git \
  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/rux-SublimeText
```

## Notes

I wrote this plugin by grafting together the Ruby, JSX, and HTML plugins. It seems to work ok. If you're good with Sublime syntax definition files, I would welcome and appreciate any feedback.
